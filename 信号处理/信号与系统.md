# Signal
Something that conveys information.
Signals are represented mathematically as functions of one or more independent variables.
1. Determinate and Random Signals
2. Continuous-time and Discrete-time Signals
3. Periodic and aperiodic Signals
4. Even and Odd Signals
## Continuous-time and Discrete-time Signals

### Continuous-Time Signals (Analog signals)
Take a value at any time instance.
### Discrete-time Signals
Defined only at discrete times.

DT signals are sequences of numbers. A DT signal is a sequence of (possibly compleumbers. A function defined on the positive and negative integers.
$$x[n]$$
`Sampling period`$T$
The time between adjacent samples of the discrete-time waveform, assumed to be a constant.
`Sampling frequency`$F_s$
The reciprocal of $T$.
Independent variable $n$
*Unit-less*.
## Basic signals

### Unit-sample or unit impulse signal / sequence (delta function)

![[Pasted image 20250306150702.jpg]]
An arbitrary sequence can be represented in the time-domain as a weighted sum of unit-sample sequence and its delayed (advanced) versions.
$$x[n]=\sum x[k]\delta [n-k]$$
### Unit-step signal / sequence

$$u(n)-u(n-4)=R_{4}(n)$$ 
0,1,2,3
$$u(-n-1)$$
### Rectangle (Gate) Signal / Sequence

### Real exponential signal / sequence
![[Pasted image 20250306152323.jpg]]
$$x(n)=a^{n}u(n)$$
### Complex exponential signal / sequence
![[Pasted image 20250306152604.jpg]]
$$e^{3\theta}=cos\theta + jsin\theta$$

### Sinusoidal signal /sequence
![[Pasted image 20250306153148.jpg]]
$$\Omega = 2\pi f$$
模拟角频率$\Omega(rad/s)$
数字角频率$\omega(rad)$
$$\Omega = nTs$$
